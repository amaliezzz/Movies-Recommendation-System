# Disney Movies Recommendation System

This project is a Streamlit application designed as a recommendation system for Disney movies and TV shows. Leveraging the capabilities of SpaCy for natural language processing, the application converts titles into vector representations. By calculating the cosine similarity between these vectors, the system effectively identifies and recommends content that closely aligns with user preferences. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also facilitates the discovery of new Disney titles tailored to individual tastes. The application provides an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to explore and receive personalized recommendations from the extensive Disney catalog.

## Usage

To run the application locally in your browser, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
